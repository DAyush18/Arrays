Arrays DSA Questions Repository

Welcome to the Arrays Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Questions repository! This project is a collection of various array-related problems, algorithms, and data structure implementations that are frequently encountered in coding interviews, competitive programming, and algorithmic challenges.

The repository aims to help you build a solid understanding of arrays, covering basic and advanced problems and solutions.
Questions & Solutions

The repository covers the following types of array-related problems:

    Basic Array Operations (Insertion, Deletion, Searching)
    Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
    Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)
    Array Manipulation (Reversing, Rotating, Merging)
    Finding Missing Elements (Duplicates, Single Element, etc.)
    Sliding Window Problems
    Prefix and Suffix Sum Problems
    Dynamic Programming (e.g., Maximum Subarray Sum, Subset Sum)
    Two Pointers Technique
    Rearranging Elements
    Finding the Kth Largest/Smallest Element
    Matrix-related Problems (Spiral Traversal, Diagonal Sums, etc.)

Each problem in this repository has a detailed explanation of the approach, followed by the implemented solution in Python (or other languages where applicable).
